# README: URL Extraction from Consolidated Cell in Excel

## Overview
This guide explains how to extract individual URLs from a consolidated cell (`B3`) using Excel functions. By using a specific formula in column `C`, you can separate each URL into individual cells, simply by dragging down the formula.

## Formula Explanation

### Main Formula in Cell `C3`
```excel
=MID($B$3, FIND(C3, $B$3, FIND("http", $B$3, 1)) + LEN($C$3), LEN($C$3))
```

### What This Formula Does
This formula extracts individual URLs from a cell containing multiple URLs (in `B3`). Hereâ€™s what each part does:

- **`MID($B$3, start_point, length)`**: 
  - Extracts text from cell `B3` starting from `start_point` for `length` characters.
  
- **`FIND(C3, $B$3, FIND("http", $B$3, 1)) + LEN($C$3)`**:
  - Finds the position of the text in cell `C3` within `B3` starting after the first "http". It then adds the length of the URL in `C3` to move to the start of the next URL.

### Simplified Version
If we break it down to the basic form:
```excel
=MID($B$3, 73, 73)
```
- **Start Point**: 73 (Position of the next "http").
- **Length**: 73 (Length of the URL to extract).

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Finding the Start Point**:
    - To find the starting point of the URLs, we use the `FIND` function:
    ```excel
    =FIND("http", B3, 1)
    ```
    - This finds the first occurrence of "http" in cell `B3`.

2. **Finding the Second URL**:
    - To find the starting point of the next URL, we use:
    ```excel
    =FIND("http", B3, 2)
    ```
    - Result (`74`) indicates that the second "http" starts at the 74th character.

3. **Extracting the First URL**:
    - Using the `LEFT` function to extract the first URL:
    ```excel
    =LEFT(B3, FIND("http", B3, 2) - 1)
    ```
    - This will extract all characters from the start of `B3` to just before the second "http".

4. **Extracting Subsequent URLs**:
    - Using a combination of `MID`, `FIND`, and `LEN` to extract the remaining URLs:
    ```excel
    =MID($B$3, FIND(C3, $B$3, FIND("http", $B$3, 1)) + LEN($C$3), LEN($C$3))
    ```
    - As you drag this formula down, it will update the start point based on the previous URL's length, allowing you to extract each subsequent URL.

## Formula Breakdown

### MID Function
- **Syntax**: `MID(text, start_num, num_chars)`
- **Example**: 
  ```excel
  =MID($B$3, 73, 73)
  ```
  - Extracts 73 characters starting from position 73 in cell `B3`.

### FIND Function
- **Syntax**: `FIND(find_text, within_text, [start_num])`
- **Example**:
  ```excel
  =FIND("http", B3, 2)
  ```
  - Finds the position of the second occurrence of "http" in cell `B3`.

### LEFT Function
- **Syntax**: `LEFT(text, num_chars)`
- **Example**:
  ```excel
  =LEFT(B3, FIND("http", B3, 2) - 1)
  ```
  - Extracts text from the left of cell `B3` up to the character before the second "http".

## Visual Representation

1. **Extracting the First URL**
   ```
   +------------------------------------------+
   | Consolidated URL in B3                   |
   +------------------------------------------+
   | "http://first-url.com ... http://second" |
   +------------------------------------------+
                       |
                       V
    +--------------------------------+
    | LEFT(B3, FIND("http", B3, 2) - 1) |
    +--------------------------------+
    | Extracted First URL            |
    +--------------------------------+
   ```

2. **Extracting Subsequent URLs**
   ```
   +------------------------------------------+
   | Extracted First URL in C3                |
   +------------------------------------------+
                       |
                       V
    +--------------------------------+
    | MID($B$3, FIND(C3, $B$3, FIND("http", $B$3, 1)) + LEN($C$3), LEN($C$3)) |
    +--------------------------------+
    | Extracted Second URL           |
    +--------------------------------+
   ```

## How to Use

1. Paste the consolidated URLs in cell `B3`.
2. Paste the formula `=LEFT(B3, FIND("http", B3, 2) - 1)` in cell `C3` to get the first URL.
3. Use the main formula `=MID($B$3, FIND(C3, $B$3, FIND("http", $B$3, 1)) + LEN($C$3), LEN($C$3))` in cell `C4`.
4. Drag down the formula to extract the rest of the URLs.

## Conclusion

This method effectively separates multiple URLs stored in a single cell into individual cells, enabling you to manage and analyze them efficiently.
